## Progression
We show the player a series of numbers that form an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two dots. The player must determine this number.

Game settings:
The recommended progression length is 10 numbers. Length can be randomly generated but must contain at least 5 numbers
The position of the hidden element changes each time (selected randomly)

You can call the game with the command
```brain-progression```
