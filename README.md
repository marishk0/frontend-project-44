This is a set of five console games based on popular mobile brain training apps. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered to be completed. Wrong answers end the game and offer to play it again.

#### Games:
* [Calculator](#calculator) - arithmetic expressions to be evaluated.
* [Progression](#progression) - search for missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
* [Definition of an even number.](#definition-of-an-even-number)
* [Finding the Greatest Common Divisor.](#finding-the-greatest-common-divisor)
* [Definition of a prime number.](#definition-of-a-prime-number)

## Calculator
The user is shown a random mathematical expression that needs to be calculated and the correct answer written down.

You can call the game with the command
```brain-calc```

## Progression
We show the player a series of numbers that form an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two dots. The player must determine this number.

Game settings:
The recommended progression length is 10 numbers. Length can be randomly generated but must contain at least 5 numbers
The position of the hidden element changes each time (selected randomly)

You can call the game with the command
```brain-progression```

## Definition of an even number
The user is shown a random number. And he needs to answer 'yes' if the number is even, or 'no' if it is odd

You can call the game with the command
```brain-even```

## Finding the Greatest Common Divisor
The user is shown two random numbers. The user must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

You can call the game with the command
```brain-gcd```

## Definition of a prime number
The user is shown a random number. And the user needs to answer 'yes' if the number is prime, or 'no' if it is not.
Information about [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_numbers)

You can call the game with the command
